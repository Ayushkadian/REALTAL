Deepfake Audio Detection This repository contains a Deepfake Audio Detection system that identifies synthetic or manipulated speech using AI/ML techniques. The model analyzes audio samples to detect deepfake characteristics such as unnatural speech patterns, spectral anomalies, and synthesis artifacts.
Features:
Deep Learning-Based Detection â€“ Uses CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers to analyze spectrograms and waveforms.
Pretrained & Custom Models â€“ Integrates models like Wav2Vec, Whisper, or custom-trained networks.
Feature Extraction â€“ MFCCs, Mel-spectrograms, and other acoustic features for classification.
Dataset Support â€“ Works with datasets like ASVspoof, FakeAVCeleb, or custom-labeled deepfake audio.
Real-Time & Batch Processing â€“ Supports both live audio and offline file analysis.
Visualization & Reports â€“ Generates confidence scores, heatmaps, and detailed reports.
ðŸš€ Tech Stack:
Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow for model training
Librosa, OpenCV for feature extraction
Flask/FastAPI for serving detection API
Streamlit/Gradio for interactive UI
